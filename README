BASH Script to Time Lapse GoPro videos with Audio included.

Script is installed in /usr/local/bin
Files to be worked on should be in their own directory. cd into that
directory and run this command to manipulate files.

GoPro uses caps so the script is looking for .MP4 as opposed to .mp4
when building a list of files.
